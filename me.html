      <h3>What I like ? Let's See</h3>
      <h4>i. Travelling</h4>
      <p>
        ::> I like travelling a lot. Exploring new places and experiencing new
        culture is what I absolutely love. I've got a
        <em>mountainous tooth</em> (like the sweet tooth). I look forward to
        visit hill stations. I'll put a link for my upcoming
        <a href="travel.html" target="_blank">tour blogs</a>.
      </p>
      <h4>ii. Reading Books</h4>
      <p>
        ::> What do i do when I don't feel sleepy ? Yes, of course, I read
        books. I have a quite large collection of books. I have read titles like
        <em
          >Harry Potter, Sherlock Holmes, Golpoguccha, Arabian Nights etc.
        </em>
        I am looking forward to read the books of Rick Riordan, like
        <em> Percy Jackson, Magnus Chase etc. </em>Reading has constantly
        increased by understanding capacity and stock of words.
      </p>
      <h4>iii. Coding</h4>
      <p>
        ::> Playing around with computer software is fun you know. I like coding
        very much. I like to develop games and web pages. I know Java, Python, C
        etc. I have my own game called <em> Interstellar Drift </em>. I'll put
        the link down below :
        <a

        >
      </p>
      <h4>iv. Physics</h4>
      <p>
        ::> How can I forget about Physics ?! It is the love of my life. Physics
        ahs always been my prime priority, focus as well as aim. I aim to be a
        physicist. An <strong>ASTROPHYSICIST</strong> to be precise. I can't
        really express my love for physics by words.
      </p>

      <h3>Fantasies, What are my Imaginations ?</h3>
      <h4>i. A Real life Eternal</h4>
      <p>
        I, myself, am halfly satisfied about the existence of gods, after I
        learned about the Big bang singularity in
        <em>Astrophysics Simplified by Madhur Sorout</em>. That is why I wonder
        if any real life eternals exist. I saw eternals in the
        <em>Eternals movie of MCU</em>.
      </p>
      <h4>i. Travelling To The Past</h4>
      <p>
        Firstly, travelling to the future <strong>IS</strong> possible. You may
        ask, How the hell, can you travel to future ? The answer is a bit
        flowery. So, first you need to travel at 95 - 98% of the speed of light
        (299, 792, 458 m/s) and then time will start running slowly for you and
        you will reach the near future.

          target="_blank"
          >More About This Here</a
        >. So, for a moving object times slows down. As light's speed is the
        cosmic speed limit, time stops for time. Thus to travel to past we need
        to go to negative time. So, we have to travel faster than light. Which
        seems impossible. Then, come the <em>PARADOXES</em>. These are
        phenomenas which will remain unexplained, even if travel to the past.

      <h4>iii. Aliens</h4>
      <p>
        I don't even need to describe it, it's already known by everyone.
