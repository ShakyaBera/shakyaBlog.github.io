    <h3>
      Today, I went to the Kolkata International Book Fair. I woke up early,
      cause' by guitar sir came to my house. So, I learned the G Minor Chord and
      a new song on the hawaiian guitar called:
      <em>"Jodi Kagoje Lekho Nam"</em>. Then I got ready and started of for the
      book faur. I had about 5500 INR in hand and my mom's credit card. My
      father had booked a cab. We enetered in the book fair by gate 4. We
      skimmed though stalls. I bought some books. All the stores were for
      Bengali books. I found some Englosh stalls tho. I bought books of Ruskin
      Bond, Paulo Coelho, the 8th harry Potter, etc. Then we had some snacks
      (which were disgusting). After roaming outside the Ananda book stall which
      was obviously crowded, we left the place. Then I returned back home. So,
      now everything is in sync again. That's all for today. See you again
      tommorrow ! Adios Amigos !
