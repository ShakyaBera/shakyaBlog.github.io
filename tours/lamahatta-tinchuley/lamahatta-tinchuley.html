        <h2>North Bengal #1: Lamhatta - Tinchuley</h2>
        <h3>
          So, here I am with my first tour blog. Believe me, this tour has been
          the best one so far.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          So without wasting any more <em>precious</em> time of yours, I will
          start off.

        <h4>DAY 1</h4>
        <p>
          On day one, we woke up at 4:00 am in the morning, because we had our
          flight at 9:05 am. We got ready boarded our cab and reached the
          airport. There we performed all the check in processes. After that, we
          had an hour to wait and nothing to do. So I started window shopping.
          Like this, I wasted a good amount of time and got ready for boarding
          our plane. Sadly I wasn't able to take pictures of the plane, or
          pictures inside the plane. Then we landed on Bagdogra, our driver was
          waiting for us. We were quite lucky and got a Tata Sumo GOLD (it is
          -24 Karat gold). Now see the video for the experiencing my journey to
          Lamahatta.
